## 🚀 About Me
I am currently majoring in computer science engineering at Akdeniz university.
I've held a number of developing roles, from UI design to mobile application development, but my latest challenge has been developing web applications and improving myself through my contributions as a software developer. I also participated in account management, which is a type of communication used to provide customers with service, and explaining code without writing it.
